# Consolidation-of-data
This Python code is an application designed for data analysis and processing. It includes code segments for importing libraries, reading and writing files, manipulating strings and lists, using conditionals and loops, and more. The application reads PDF files and extracts information from websites to consolidate everything into an Excel spreadsheet. Each part read is written in a separate tab in the Excel workbook. The code is well-structured and organized with comments that explain the functionality of each code segment. It is a useful tool for anyone who needs to extract data from PDF files and websites and consolidate it into a single Excel file.

It is important to note that the code was written in Portuguese to run on the company's computer and to meet a real client's needs. As such, file paths and other changes may need to be adapted. Additionally, the spreadsheet is confidential because it contains sensitive financial data of clients and will not be made available.
